# FLSUN-V400-Top-Razer

If you install to your V400 enclosure - for sure you need to close holes at the bottom of the printer top part.

You can cut it by laser from solid peace of material or you can split model in sliser to 3 parts, print it and then glue to one detail.

You can find file for that in this repo.
